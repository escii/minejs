How to install it
-----------------
execute the following script in a bash shell terminal.
./install.sh 

How to run 
----------
just execute ./mine.js  or node mine.js from the minejs directory.
don't forget to add yourself to the ops.txt file if you not already did it.
login to minecraft and run //help
remeber whitelist might be enabled therefore you may need to //whitelist <username> 
further users, before they are able to login.
